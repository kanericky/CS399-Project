  emailTitle: <b> A call to Finance Minister for urgent targeted financial support</b>
  emailContent: "It is devastating to see good businesses closing and others close
    to it. There is an urgent need for support, and whilst no one wants to have to
    ask Government for a handout, we want businesses to be able to get through this
    pandemic with their teams intact. Despite ongoing calls for targeted financial
    assistance, there is nothing in place right now when people really need it.\r\n\r\nToday,
    along with other central Auckland business associations - Karangahape Road, Newmarket,
    Parnell, Ponsonby and Uptown - we are urging the Minister of Finance to put in
    place targeted financial support, including wage subsidies and resurgence payments,
    and access to low cost, easy to repay money. Collectively we cannot stand by
    and watch more businesses fail and our neighbourhoods suffer.\r\nWhilst under
    the Red light businesses can open, there is not a sustainable level of customers
    and staffing is a challenge. The end of the month is looming and payables are
    due. \r\nWe love our city centre and we are confident in its long term future,
    but the cost of doing nothing now is too great. As well as the high cost on people\u2019s
    lives and livelihoods, we run the risk of not having a vibrant central Auckland,
    just when we want to showcase our city when the border reopens.\r\n\nYou can
    read the letter <a herf>here</a>. \r\n\nKind Regards,\nHeart of the city\r\n"
